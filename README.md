# EducationalInstituteWebsite
In this project, we have designed frontend on theme of an Educational Institute, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This website has pages like: Home, Contact Us, Courses, About Us, Admission Form and Image Gallery.
Additionally, to  locate the institute, we have embedded Google Map's service.
There is also a section that displays the testimonials.
And at last, there are links to the institute's social media handle like Meta, Instagram, etc.
So, this project has all the basic, but essential components that should be there in a school's or college's website.
